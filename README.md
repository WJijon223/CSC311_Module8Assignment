# Client-Server Messaging Example

This project is a simple client-server messaging application built using Java and JavaFX. It demonstrates how to establish communication between a client and a server using sockets and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for sending and receiving messages.

## Features

- **Client-Server Communication**: Uses Java sockets for real-time communication.
- **JavaFX GUI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for both the client and server.
- **Multi-threading**: Handles message sending and receiving on separate threads.
- **Retry Mechanism**: The client retries connecting to the server if the connection fails.
- **Message Display**: Displays sent and received messages in a chat-like interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Framework**: JavaFX
